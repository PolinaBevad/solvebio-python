class Filter(object):
    """
    Filter objects.

    Makes it easier to create filters cumulatively using ``&`` (and),
    ``|`` (or) and ``~`` (not) operations.

    For example::

        f = F()
        f &= F(price='Free')
        f |= F(style='Mexican')

    creates a filter "price = 'Free' or style = 'Mexican'".

    Each set of kwargs in a `Filter` are ANDed together:

        * `<field>=''` uses a term filter (exact term)
        * `<field>__in=[]` uses a terms filter (match any)

    String terms are not analyzed and are always assumed to be exact matches.

    Numeric columns can be selected by range using:

        * `<field>__gt`: greater than
        * `<field>__gte`: greater than or equal to
        * `<field>__lt`: less than
        * `<field>__lte`: less than or equal to

    Field action examples:

        TCGA.somatic_mutations.select(gene__in=['BRCA', 'GATA3'],
                                      chr='3',
                                      start__gt=10000,
                                      end__lte=20000)
